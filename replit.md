**Key Design Patterns**:
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Modular page structure under `/app` directory with feature-specific routes
- Reusable UI components in `/components` with specialized sub-directories for complex features
- Custom hooks and utilities for shared logic
- Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement

**Core Features**:
1. **Dashboard** - Market overview, asset tracking, liquidity monitoring
2. **Scanner** - Real-time Solana token analysis with 40+ commands for deep inspection
3. **Trending** - Live token feeds from multiple sources (Moralis, DexScreener, Pump.fun)
4. **Sniper** - Automated trading system with copy trading, token sniping, and transaction bundling
5. **Portfolio** - Wallet management and operations
6. **Tracker** - Wallet performance tracking
7. **Deployer** - Token creation and deployment tools
8. **Meta** - Market meta-analysis and trend identification with AI-powered launch assistant
9. **Rewards** - Gamification and leaderboard system

### Data Layer & APIs

**Primary Data Sources**:
- **Moralis API**: Trending tokens, new token discovery, token metadata
- **Helius RPC**: Solana blockchain interaction, token metadata, holder data, transaction history
- **Jupiter API**: Real-time price data and DEX aggregation
- **DexScreener API**: Market data, volume, liquidity information
- **Bitquery API**: Advanced blockchain queries and trading data
- **Pump.fun API**: Platform-specific token data and metas
- **CaesarX Backend API**: Custom automation and bundler services
- **xAI Grok API**: AI-powered insights and ticker suggestions based on market metas

**Service Layer Pattern**:
- Singleton service classes for each external API (`/lib/services/`)
- Centralized error handling and rate limiting
- Caching strategies to minimize API calls
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures

**Scanner System**:
- Multi-source token search by Solana contract address
- Command-based analysis system with 40+ specialized commands grouped by category:
  - Overview (stats, search, heatmaps)
  - Wallets & Holders (top holders, whale maps, common traders)
  - Early & Snipers (early buyers, PnL tracking)
  - Security/Risk (bundle checks, DEX verification, domain age)
  - Wallet Tools (analyzer, funding trace)

**Meta AI Assistant**:
- Grok AI-powered chat interface for market meta analysis
- Floating chat icon with transparent card window UI
- Context-aware responses based on live meta data (top metas, scores, trends)
- Provides creative ticker suggestions with names, descriptions, and lore
- Strategic insights for memecoin launches aligned with current market trends
- Direct integration with deployer page for seamless token creation
- Both streaming and non-streaming chat modes supported

### Automation & Trading System

**Sniper Architecture**:
Three distinct automation modes with shared execution infrastructure:

1. **Copy Trading**: Mirror trades from target wallets with configurable limits and filters
2. **Token Sniping**: Automated new token purchases based on ticker patterns and dev parameters
3. **Transaction Bundling**: Multi-step transaction recipes with MEV protection via Jito

**Execution Pipeline**:
- Transaction preparation on backend (`/prepare` endpoint)
- Local signing in Portfolio (keys never leave client)
- Bundle chunking (â‰¤5 transactions per Jito limit)
- Relay through Jito with rate limiting
- Execution monitoring and failure handling

**Safety Features**:
- Daily spending caps and per-transaction limits
- Rate limiting and cooldown periods
- Guard checks (price impact, liquidity, output protection)
- Dry-run mode for testing strategies
- Comprehensive logging system

### State Management

**Zustand Stores**:
- `scanner.ts`: Search queries, filters, selected tokens, command results
- `sniper.ts`: Automations, wallets, execution state, logs

**Store Patterns**:
- Single source of truth for feature-specific state
- Actions co-located with state
- Persistence for critical data
- Type-safe interfaces for all state shapes

### Security & Configuration

**Environment Variables**:
- API keys for all external services
- RPC endpoints with fallbacks
- Feature flags for experimental features
- Development vs production configuration

**Security Measures**:
- Private keys stored locally only (Portfolio as wallet manager)
- API keys in environment variables, never hardcoded
- CORS and rate limiting on API routes
- Input validation on all user inputs
